# Home Credit Default Risk Analysis

#### -- Project Status: [Active]

## Objective
The objective of this project is to predict potential credit repayment difficulties among clients using a robust machine learning model. The project is based on the dataset provided by Home Credit, a service dedicated to offering lines of credit (loans) to unbanked individuals.

## Overview
This study begins with the acquisition and merging of relevant datasets. Following a rigorous feature engineering process, a comprehensive dataset is created for model development. Several feature selection strategies, including Recursive Feature Elimination with XGBoost, Linear Discriminant Analysis, and Mutual Information Coefficient, are implemented. The machine learning models utilized include XGBoost and CatBoost, optimized using Hyperopt for hyperparameter tuning. The project concludes with a comprehensive evaluation of model performance, emphasizing precision, recall, and ROC-AUC metrics.
