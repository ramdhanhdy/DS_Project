# Optimizing Customer Segmentation Using RFM and Unsupervised Methods


## Executive Summary

**Business Objective:**

To optimize marketing campaigns by integrating the valuable insights derived from RFM variables, alongside customer demographics and behavioral data, and further enhancing segmentation effectiveness through advanced techniques like UMAP (Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection) and HDBSCAN

**Key Findings:**

- In the preliminary analysis, an observation was made regarding the traditional RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) segments. It was noted that these segments did not sufficiently distinguish between customers of different age groups, particularly those aged 60 years and older. Notably, this older demographic consisted of a substantial number of high-value spenders. This discovery prompted an exploration of more advanced segmentation methods.

**Data Preprocessing:**

This first notebook focused on preparing the data for analysis. Tasks included handling missing data, calculating customer ages, and data preparation for further investigation.

**Project Scope:**

- **Notebook 1:** Data Preprocessing 
- **Notebook 2:** Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with an Emphasis on RFM Analysis
- **Notebook 3:** Advanced Customer Segmentation Using UMAP and HDBSCAN

**Insights Post-Segmentation:**

Advanced techniques revealed seven distinct customer groups, each with unique behaviors and demographics. Group quality was assessed using the DBCV score.
