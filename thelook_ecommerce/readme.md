**Project status**: Planning

**Goal**: 
The goal of this project is to leverage data-driven insights to optimize business operations within the dynamic e-commerce landscape. I aim to achieve the following:

- `Descriptive Analysis`: Understand historical trends and customer behaviors to gain insights into past performance.
- `Predictive Analysis`: Anticipate future trends and demands to make informed decisions.
- `Prescriptive Analysis`: Provide actionable recommendations for enhancing sales, user engagement, and cost-efficiency.

**Method**:
I will approach this project in three distinct phases, each focusing on specific aspects of the data and utilizing storytelling techniques to communicate findings effectively.

## **Descriptive Analysis: Understanding the Past**

- **Objective:** Provide a clear understanding of past events and trends in the e-commerce business.

- Use descriptive statistics to profile customers. Create customer segments based on demographics from the **`users`** table, such as age and gender.
- Tell a story about how the e-commerce business has evolved over time, which products have been the most successful, and the characteristics of their customer base.

## **Predictive Analysis: Anticipating the Future**

- **Objective:** Predict future trends and outcomes based on historical data.
- **Storytelling Method:** Scenario-driven storytelling.

### **Project 2: Demand Forecasting and Inventory Optimization**

- Utilize the **`inventory_items`** and historical sales data to build a demand forecasting model. Predict demand for products in the near future.
- Develop scenarios for different demand levels and identify potential stockouts or overstock situations.
- Tell a story about how the company can optimize inventory management and ensure products are available when needed while minimizing excess inventory costs.

### **Project 3: Customer Churn Prediction**

- Use data from the **`orders`** and **`users`** tables to create a churn prediction model. Identify factors that lead to customer churn.
- Build scenarios to estimate the potential impact of reducing churn on revenue.
- Tell a story about how the e-commerce platform can proactively retain customers and increase customer lifetime value.

## **Descriptive Analysis: Guiding Actions**

- **Objective:** Provide actionable recommendations based on data-driven insights..
- **Storytelling Method:** Decision-focused storytelling.

### **Project 4: Personalized Product Recommendations**

- Combine data from the **`events`**, **`products`**, and user behavior to build a recommendation engine.
- Use A/B testing to evaluate the impact of personalized recommendations on user engagement and conversion rates.
- Craft a narrative emphasizing how personalized product recommendations can elevate the user experience and drive increased sales.

### **Project 5: Pricing Optimization**

- Analyze competitor pricing data and customer behavior to optimize product pricing.
- Develop pricing strategies for different products and customer segments.
- Construct a narrative illustrating how dynamic pricing can maximize revenue and competitiveness in the market.

### **Project 6: Supply Chain Optimization**

- Analyze data from the **`distribution_centre`** table and shipping data to optimize the supply chain and reduce shipping costs.
- Recommend changes in distribution center locations or shipping routes based on cost and efficiency.
- Develop a narrative showcasing how supply chain optimization can enhance cost-efficiency and improve overall customer satisfaction.
