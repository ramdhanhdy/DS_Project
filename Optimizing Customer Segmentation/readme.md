# Marketing Campaign Analysis


## Executive Summary

**Business Objective:**

The aim was to optimize marketing campaigns for better effectiveness by grouping customers based on their behavior and demographics.

**Context:**

During the initial analysis, it was observed that traditional RFM segments didn't adequately capture differences in customer ages. This prompted exploration of advanced segmentation methods.

**Data Preprocessing:**

This first notebook focused on preparing the data for analysis. Tasks included handling missing data, calculating customer ages, and data preparation for further investigation.

**Project Scope:**

- **Notebook 1:** Data Preprocessing 
- **Notebook 2:** Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with an Emphasis on RFM Analysis
- **Notebook 3:** Advanced Customer Segmentation Using UMAP and HDBSCAN

**Insights Post-Segmentation:**

Advanced techniques revealed seven distinct customer groups, each with unique behaviors and demographics. Group quality was assessed using the DBCV score.
