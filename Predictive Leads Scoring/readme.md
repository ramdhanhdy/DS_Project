# Customer Segmentation and Predictive Lead Scoring

This project aims to develop a comprehensive understanding of our customer base and create a predictive model for lead conversion. By leveraging advanced analytics and machine learning techniques, we seek to improve our marketing strategies and sales efficiency.

## Objective

The main objective of this project is to:
1. Segment customers based on their attributes and behaviors
2. Develop a predictive model to score leads based on their likelihood to convert

## Components

### 1. Customer Segmentation

- Apply clustering algorithms (e.g., K-means, hierarchical clustering) on customer attributes and behaviors
- Profile each segment to understand characteristics and needs

### 2. Predictive Lead Scoring Model

- Develop a machine learning model to predict lead conversion probability
- Utilize features from segmentation analysis for enhanced predictions

## Deliverables

1. Detailed customer segment profiles
2. Interactive dashboard for segment visualization
3. Predictive lead scoring model with API integration for real-time scoring
4. Feature importance analysis for key conversion drivers
